# Neovim Configs

These are my neovim configs that I've backed up here for being able to duplicate on other machines.

You need Packer to install the packages and you need to run `PackerInstall` followed by `PackerSync` and `TSUpdate` to ensure you're getting everything up-to-date for the lastest stable configs if you're planning to use my configs to serve as your own kickstart.
